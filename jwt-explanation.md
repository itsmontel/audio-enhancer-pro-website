# JWT Tokens in Supabase - Simple Explanation

## 🔑 What JWT Tokens Do

JWT (JSON Web Token) tokens are like **digital ID cards** that prove:
- Who you are (authentication)
- What you can access (authorization)
- When the ID expires (security)

## 🏗️ Your Supabase JWT Setup

### 1. **Anon Key** (Public JWT) - Already Set ✅

```

**Purpose:** Allows your Chrome extension to connect to Supabase
**Security:** Safe to expose in frontend code
**Permissions:** Limited by Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### 2. **User JWT** (Generated Automatically)
When users sign in, Supabase automatically creates a **personal JWT** for them:

```javascript
// When user signs in, Supabase gives them a personal JWT
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession()
console.log(session.access_token) // This is their personal JWT
```

**Purpose:** Identifies the specific user
**Security:** Automatically managed by Supabase
**Permissions:** Full access to their own data only

## 🛡️ Security Flow

```
1. Chrome Extension starts with → Anon JWT (limited access)
2. User signs in → Gets personal JWT (full access to their data)
3. User signs out → Back to Anon JWT (limited access)
```

## 🚫 What You DON'T Need

- ❌ Manual JWT secret configuration
- ❌ Custom JWT generation
- ❌ Token refresh logic
- ❌ Security key management

**Supabase handles all of this automatically!**

## 🔍 Where to Find Your Keys

If you ever need to check your JWT tokens:

1. **Go to:** https://odlcxblrzhstuoosawea.supabase.co
2. **Navigate to:** Settings > API
3. **You'll see:**
   - **anon/public key** (JWT for frontend)
   - **service_role key** (JWT for backend - keep secret!)

## ✅ Bottom Line

Your JWT tokens are **already perfectly configured**. You can proceed with the implementation without any JWT worries!
